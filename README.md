# AI Virtual Mouse Project

The repository is mainly built upon MediaPipe, OpenCV and PyAutoGui. While MediaPipe offers a number of functionalities to perform hand tracking, OpenCV helps users to interact with these models. PyAutoGUI lets Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications.

This repo lets users utilize the mouse with just their fingers. This repo has 2 modes:
* Roaming Mode: You can use the index finger to move aroud the mouse.
* Clicking Mode: You can use both index and middle fingers together to perform the clicking action.

To run:
  ```
  python AiVirtualMouseProject.py
  ```
